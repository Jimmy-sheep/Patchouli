# Introduction

Welcome to Patchouli, a mod aimed at providing High Quality Data-Driven Documentation for Modders and Modpack Makers. Mouthful of a slogan isn't it?

:::caution

Because of limited resources, this website is usually targeted only towards the latest version of Minecraft and Patchouli available.

If you need documentation for an older Minecraft version, please use (and donate to!) the
[Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/), or if you're comfortable reading
plain text or compiling the site yourself, visit the `web/` directory of the older
branches on [GitHub](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Patchouli/tree/master/web).
